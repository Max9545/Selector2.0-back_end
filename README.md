# Selector Back End

This is the backend engine Selector, a web application that connects users with Spotify and Discogs, for a seamless, music browsing (and eventually "purchasing") experience. The application is built with service oriented architecture. The backend communicates with the frontend using a single GraphQL endpoint, which supplies data from multiple other endpoints. The database currently stores "Favorites", but there are plans for much more, startign with users.
