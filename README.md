# Selector Back End

This is the backend engine Selector, a web application that connects users with Spotify and Discogs, for a seamless, music browsing (and eventually "purchasing") experience. The application is built with service oriented architecture. The backend communicates with the frontend using our choice of "stretch technology" for this project, as a single GraphQL endpoint, which supplies data from multiple other endpoints the Back End is interacting with. The database currently stores "Favorites", but there are plans for much more, starting with users.

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. Endpoints can be added to GraphQL, if you plan to use this Back End engine with the frontend web application, however if the endpoints are changed subsequent updates will be necessary on the Frontend repository code.

#### Prerequisites

* __Ruby__

  - The project is built with rubyonrails using __ruby version 2.5.3p105__, you must install ruby on your local machine first. Please visit the [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) home page to get set up. _Please ensure you install the version of ruby noted above._

* __Rails__
  ```sh
  gem install rails --version 5.2.5
  ```

* __Postgres database__
  - Visit the [postgresapp](https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html) homepage and follow their instructions to download the latest version of Postgres app.


#### Installing

1. Clone the repo
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/selector-turing/back_end
  ```

2. Bundle Install
  ```
  $ bundle install
  ```

3. Create, migrate and seed rails database
  ```
  $ rails db:{create,migrate}
  ```

### Endpoint

| /graphql |

All endpoints use a `POST` method. 

#### API Contract

All endpoints rely on GraphQL to perform queries and mutations of data.  

1. The following queries rely on the third-party APIs from Discogs and Spotify: [album](#album), [randomAlbum](#randomAlbum), [artistAlbums](#artistAlbums), and [spotifyAlbumID](#spotifyAlbumID). 
2. The follwoing queries and mutation rely on the the internal database of the app: [favorites](#favorites) and [createFavorite](#createFavorite).
